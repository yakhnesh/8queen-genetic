# 8queen-genetic
This 8 queen problem can get one solution using genetic algorithm. Depending on the number of iterations there is a chance that it outputs the error called
stackoverflowerror due method being recursively called too much. In order to fix that you would need to increase the stack trace to 35mb thread stack trace
